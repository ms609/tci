# TotalCopheneticIndex
R package implementing the Total Cophenetic Index measure of Mir _et al._ (2013).
This package is now simply a wrapper for the function `TotalCopheneticIndex()`
in the package '[TreeTools](https://ms609.github.io/TreeTools/).

The total cophenetic index describes how balanced a phylogenetic tree is,
by measuring the how deep the most recent common ancestor of each pair of leaves
lies within the tree.

This functionality is now available via Rogter's (unmaintained?) [CollessLike](https://github.com/LuciaRotger/CollessLike) R package.
